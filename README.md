>_**This BWAPI-AI/UDAI (User defined AI) works as an in-game helper and also as an online replay analyzer.
It can help the players at-all-levels to improve, also to test and sense and remember things that weren't easy/possible before.**_
# Coach AI has arrived !

> _**Note**_:
* CoachAI works only with StarCraft v1.16.1 using ChaosLauncher.
* When playing in ICCUP, the game is logged and you'll get the win/lose points, this won't happen if one of the players is Computer.

> #  Features in-game & in-replay:
- The RealTime measure of Macro (train/build/upgrade) is here, Terran repairs not accounted, many players still measure it just by the used supplies at specific time or by inaccurate replay analysis tools, in-replay you can know @any second who is the best Macro player (same as the score screen you see at the end of game/replay).
- Want to know how many unit/building has been lost in-game/in-replay ?, just select one of the same type.
- The # of units/buildings and also the ones in-progress, and the remaining build time for each one in progress, also the remaining time for each Tech/Upgrade in progress.
- Buildings that has Rally Point will draw a line to the RP.
- Displaying the number of the assigned mineral workers on each Nexus/CC/Hatchery.
- WorkersCut measure, counts the time that Nexus/CC has been idle, if you have 2 bases the counter will be doubled, 3 -> tripled, etc.., it works for P & T, not Z.
- Idle Workers measure displays the number of idle workers, and the total lost time (as with Workers Cut, this increase when there is more Idle Workers).
- Minerals Above measure that counts the time of being above 250/500/750/1000 minerals.
